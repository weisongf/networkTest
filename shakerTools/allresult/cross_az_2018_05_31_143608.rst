OpenStack L2 Cross-AZ
*********************

In this scenario Shaker launches pairs of instances in the same tenant network.
Every instance is hosted on a separate compute node, all available compute
nodes are utilized. The master and slave instances are in different
availability zones. The scenario is used to test throughput between `nova` and
`vcenter` zones. The traffic goes within the tenant network (L2 domain).

**Scenario**:

.. code-block:: yaml

    deployment:
      accommodation:
      - pair
      - single_room
      - zones:
        - nova
        - vcenter
      - cross_az
      template: l2.hot
