OpenStack L3 North-South
************************

In this scenario Shaker launches pairs of instances on different compute nodes.
All available compute nodes are utilized. Instances are in different networks
connected to different routers, master accesses slave by floating ip. The
traffic goes from one network via external network to the other network.
