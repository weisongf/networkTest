OpenStack L3 East-West
**********************

In this scenario Shaker launches pairs of instances, each instance on its own
compute node. All available compute nodes are utilized. Instances are connected
to one of 2 tenant networks, which plugged into single router. The traffic goes
from one network to the other (L3 east-west).

**Scenario**:

.. code-block:: yaml

    deployment:
      accommodation:
      - pair
