OpenStack L3 East-West UDP
**************************

In this scenario Shaker launches pairs of instances, each instance on its own
compute node. Instances are connected to one of 2 tenant networks, which
plugged into single router. The traffic goes from one network to the other (L3
east-west). The load is generated by UDP traffic.

**Scenario**:

.. code-block:: yaml

    deployment:
      accommodation:
      - pair
      - single_room
