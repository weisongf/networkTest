OpenStack L3 North-South UDP
****************************

In this scenario Shaker launches pairs of instances on different compute nodes.
Instances are in different networks connected to different routers, master
accesses slave by floating ip. The traffic goes from one network via external
network to the other network. The load is generated by UDP traffic.

**Scenario**:

.. code-block:: yaml

    deployment:
      accommodation:
      - pair
      - single_room
      template: l3_north_south.hot
