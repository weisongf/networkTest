OpenStack L3 East-West Performance
**********************************

In this scenario Shaker launches 1 pair of instances, each instance on its own
compute node. Instances are connected to one of 2 tenant networks, which
plugged into single router. The traffic goes from one network to the other (L3
east-west).
